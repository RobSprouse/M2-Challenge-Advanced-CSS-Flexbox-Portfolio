## Description

This Repo was created to complete the University Of Richmond's, Coding Bootcamp, Module 2 Challenge. The challenge was to build a portfolio website from scratch that can be added to as progression is made in the class. The following User Story and Acceptance Criteria was used to achieve the primary objective.

## User Story

>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
>SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
>```
>
>
>## Acceptance Criteria
>
>Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:
>
>```
>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
>WHEN I load their portfolio
>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
>THEN I am taken to that deployed application
>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
>```
